Uploading files With git bash in to git hub

note: download the git in you pc/laptop to complete this task

s1: go to file which you want to upload

s2: right click and go to show more options then click git bash here.

s3: git init

check the directory for uploading the files (main/master)

if you want to change the directory then

s4: git branch -M main (skip if default, if not type this line)

s5: git add .

s6: git commit -m "first commit"

s7: git remote add origin (path of repository)

s8: git push -u origin main (if your directory in masther then replace master in place of main)

* if you encountered with local this following :
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

git push -u origin main --force(if your directory in masther then replace master in place of main)

Note: This force only usfull only for empty repositories...

The --force option for git push allows you to override this rule: the commit history on the remote will be forcefully overwritten with your own local history. This is a rather dangerous process, because it's very easy to overwrite (and thereby lose) commits from your colleagues.
